# Friend Finder

Author: Tim Schaeken

Packages used:

* Express.js

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of routing, REST API structure, and coded ORM. On top of this, I experimented with splitting .js files up by function such as having a seperate folder and files for routes, connections, and logic.

## Use

To use Friend Finder simply fill out the survey and see your results! On submit `/api/submit` is called, which runs through `logic.comparison` and returns the most compatible friend in our system!
